# Data Structures & Algorithms Projects

This repository contains a collection of small projects created during my journey through Abdul Bari's course, **"Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++,"** on Udemy. These projects were developed as part of my preparation for the university course **"Informatics 2,"** which is renowned for being one of the most challenging modules in my Bachelor's program.

## Project Highlights

- Implementation of various data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and AVL trees.
- Algorithms focusing on sorting, searching, and recursion.
- Practical examples that demonstrate the application of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world problems.
